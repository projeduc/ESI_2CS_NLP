	ABSTRACT = {The task of coreference resolution has attracted considerable attention in the literature due to its importance in deep language understanding and its potential as a subtask in a variety of complex natural language processing problems. In this study, we outlined the field&rsquo;s terminology, describe existing metrics, their differences and shortcomings, as well as the available corpora and external resources. We analyzed existing state-of-the-art models and approaches, and reviewed recent advances and trends in the field, namely end-to-end systems that jointly model different subtasks of coreference resolution, and cross-lingual systems that aim to overcome the challenges of less-resourced languages. Finally, we discussed the main challenges and open issues faced by coreference resolution systems.},

	abstract = "Mention detection is an important preprocessing step for annotation and interpretation in applications such as NER and coreference resolution, but few stand-alone neural models have been proposed able to handle the full range of mentions. In this work, we propose and compare three neural network-based approaches to mention detection. The first approach is based on the mention detection part of a state of the art coreference resolution system; the second uses ELMO embeddings together with a bidirectional LSTM and a biaffine classifier; the third approach uses the recently introduced BERT model. Our best model (using a biaffine classifier) achieves gains of up to 1.8 percentage points on mention recall when compared with a strong baseline in a HIGH RECALL coreference annotation setting. The same model achieves improvements of up to 5.3 and 6.2 p.p. when compared with the best-reported mention detection F1 on the CONLL and CRAC coreference data sets respectively in a HIGH F1 annotation setting. We then evaluate our models for coreference resolution by using mentions predicted by our best model in start-of-the-art coreference systems. The enhanced model achieved absolute improvements of up to 1.7 and 0.7 p.p. when compared with our strong baseline systems (pipeline system and end-to-end system) respectively. For nested NER, the evaluation of our model on the GENIA corpora shows that our model matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models despite not being specifically designed for this task.",
