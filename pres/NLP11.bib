	abstract="Numerous approaches for identifying important content for automatic text summarization have been developed to date. Topic representation approaches first derive an intermediate representation of the text that captures the topics discussed in the input. Based on these representations of topics, sentences in the input document are scored for importance. In contrast, in indicator representation approaches, the text is represented by a diverse set of possible indicators of importance which do not aim at discovering topicality. These indicators are combined, very often using machine learning techniques, to score the importance of each sentence. Finally, a summary is produced by selecting sentences in a greedy approach, choosing the sentences that will go in the summary one by one, or globally optimizing the selection, choosing the best set of sentences to form a summary. In this chapter we give a broad overview of existing approaches based on these distinctions, with particular attention on how representation, sentence scoring or summary selection strategies alter the overall performance of the summarizer. We also point out some of the peculiarities of the task of summarization which have posed challenges to machine learning approaches for the problem, and some of the suggested solutions.",

	abstract="Machine translation is an important technology socio-politically, commercially and scientifically, despite many misconceptions about its success or lack of it over the decades. The emergence of the Internet as one of the main media of modern communication has turned translation into a bridge that connects speakers of different languages. The endless traffic of communication between different language groups requires translation, but when instant translations are needed, human translators are not able to supply them fast enough. A highly skilled profession like translation using human translators is expensive and also slow, especially when a large number of languages and subject fields are involved. In order to meet the growing translation demand, machine translation systems are seen as a cost-effective alternative to human translators in a variety of situations. Ever since the first system was built, machine translation has been presenting scientific challenges (see also Nirenburg 1996). It became the testing ground for many experiments and applications for natural-language processing, artificial intelligence and even linguistics (Arnold etal. 1994: 4--5).",

Our approach combines a search component based on bigram hashing and TF-IDF matching with a multi-layer recurrent neural network model trained to detect answers in Wikipedia paragraphs. Our experiments on multiple existing QA datasets indicate that (1) both modules are highly competitive with respect to existing counterparts and (2) multitask learning using distant supervision on their combination is an effective complete system on this challenging task.",

Dialog state tracking is crucial to the success of a dialog system, yet until recently there were no common resources, hampering progress. The Dialog State Tracking Challenge series of 3 tasks introduced the first shared testbed and evaluation metrics for dialog state tracking, and has underpinned three key advances in dialog state tracking: the move from generative to discriminative models; the adoption of discriminative sequential techniques; and the incorporation of the speech recognition results directly into the dialog state tracker.

A prototype HIS system for the tourist information domain is evaluated and compared with a baseline MDP system using both user simulations and a live user trial.

	abstract = {Sentiments or opinions from social media provide the most up-to-date and inclusive information, due to the proliferation of social media and the low barrier for posting the message. Despite the growing importance of sentiment analysis, this area lacks a concise and systematic arrangement of prior efforts. It is essential to: (1) analyze its progress over the years, (2) provide an overview of the main advances achieved so far, and (3) outline remaining limitations. Several essential aspects, therefore, are addressed within the scope of this survey. On the one hand, this paper focuses on presenting typical methods from three different perspectives (task-oriented, granularity-oriented, methodology-oriented) in the area of sentiment analysis. Specifically, a large quantity of techniques and methods are categorized and compared. On the other hand, different types of data and advanced tools for research are introduced, as well as their limitations. On the basis of these materials, the essential prospects lying ahead for sentiment analysis are identified and discussed.}

	abstract="There has been a significant increase in the volume of Arabic dialect messages on social networks, providing a rich source for opinion mining research. Most research works done on Arabic dialect focus on messages written in Arabic script, with very limited scope on Latin script. In this paper, we are interested in the classification of social networks messages retrieved from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube written in Algerian dialect in Latin script into positive or negative classes using existing opinion mining approaches (lexical-based, machine learning, and hybrid). Also, we apply a regrouping process in the preprocessing step to overcome the issues related to the Algerian dialect such as the orthographic varieties to express the same word. Furthermore, we focus on the hybrid approach which consists in automatically annotating the training corpus with the lexical-based approach and then use the machine learning approach on this corpus for creating the classification model. This approach allows classifying the messages into positive or negative classes, without having to annotate manually a training corpus.",

	abstract = "Arabizi is a form of writing Arabic text which relies on Latin letters, numerals and punctuation rather than Arabic letters. In the literature, the difficulties associated with Arabizi sentiment analysis have been underestimated, principally due to the complexity of Arabizi. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically classify sentiments of Arabizi messages into positives or negatives. In the proposed approach, Arabizi messages are first transliterated into Arabic. Afterwards, we automatically classify the sentiment of the transliterated corpus using an automatically annotated corpus. For corpus validation, shallow machine learning algorithms such as Support Vectors Machine (SVM) and Naive Bays (NB) are used. Simulations results demonstrate the outperformance of NB algorithm over all others. The highest achieved F1-score is up to 78{\%} and 76{\%} for manually and automatically transliterated dataset respectively. Ongoing work is aimed at improving the transliterator module and annotated sentiment dataset.",

	abstract = "{Evaluating readability of web documents has gained attention due to several factors such as improving the effectiveness of writing and to reach a wider spectrum of audience. Current practices in this direction follow several statistical measures in evaluating readability of the document. In this paper, we have proposed a machine learning-based model to compute readability of web pages. The minimum educational standards required (grade level) to understand the contents of a web page are also computed. The proposed model classifies the web pages into highly readable, readable or less readable using specified feature set. To classify a web page with the aforementioned categories, we have incorporated the features such as sentence count, word count, syllable count, type-token ratio and lexical ambiguity. To increase the usability of the proposed model, we have developed an accessible browser extension to perform the assessments of every web page loaded into the browser.}",

In this study, we present a thorough comparison between cutting-edged techniques currently being used in this area, with a special focus on the various deep learning methods. This study explores different feature extraction methods, state-of-the-art classification models, and vis-a-vis their impact on an ASR. As deep learning techniques are very data-dependent different speech datasets that are available online are also discussed in detail. In the end, the various online toolkits, resources, and language models that can be helpful in the formulation of an ASR are also proffered. In this study, we captured every aspect that can impact the performance of an ASR. Hence, we speculate that this work is a good starting point for academics interested in ASR research.},

It allows researchers to calculate readability for Arabic text with and without diacritics. OSMAN is a modified version of the conventional readability formulas such as Flesch and Fog. In our work we introduce a novel approach towards counting short, long and stress syllables in Arabic which is essential for judging readability of Arabic narratives. We also introduce an additional factor called {``}Faseeh{''} which considers aspects of script usually dropped in informal Arabic writing. To evaluate our methods we used Spearman{'}s correlation metric to compare text readability for 73,000 parallel sentences from English and Arabic UN documents. The Arabic sentences were written with the absence of diacritics and in order to count the number of syllables we added the diacritics in using an open source tool called Mishkal. The results show that OSMAN readability formula correlates well with the English ones making it a useful tool for researchers and educators working with Arabic text.",
