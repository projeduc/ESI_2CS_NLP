	abstract="The Penn Treebank, in its eight years of operation (1989--1996), produced approximately 7 million words of part-of-speech tagged text, 3 million words of skeletally parsed text, over 2 million words of text parsed for predicateargument structure, and 1.6 million words of transcribed spoken text annotated for speech disfluencies. This paper describes the design of the three annotation schemes used by the Treebank: POS tagging, syntactic bracketing, and disfluency annotation and the methodology employed in production. All available Penn Treebank materials are distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium http://www.ldc.upenn.edu.",

	abstract = "To facilitate future research in unsupervised induction of syntactic structure and to standardize best-practices, we propose a tagset that consists of twelve universal part-of-speech categories. In addition to the tagset, we develop a mapping from 25 different treebank tagsets to this universal set. As a result, when combined with the original treebank data, this universal tagset and mapping produce a dataset consisting of common parts-of-speech for 22 different languages. We highlight the use of this resource via three experiments, that (1) compare tagging accuracies across languages, (2) present an unsupervised grammar induction approach that does not use gold standard part-of-speech tags, and (3) use the universal tags to transfer dependency parsers between languages, achieving state-of-the-art results.",
